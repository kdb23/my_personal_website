                <h3>A Little About Me</h3>
                <p>In 2017 I began a career as a perioperative nurse at a level one trauma center in my homestate of North Carolina. It was a very rewarding job
                    that gave a firm foundation of skills that would later be expanded upon when travel nursing. Nursing has been an integral part
                    of my life but sadly no longer carries the same sense of pride and accomplishment. Traveling nursing enabled me to experince many
                    new things that would not have ever been possible. I am very thankful for what nursing has taught me over the years but looking forward to starting 
                    something new. Throughout this project there are photos from the many adventures taken while having a nomadic lifestyle of relocating every thirteen weeks.</p>
