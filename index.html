                <p>Welcome to my personal webiste. This webpage was created for Flatiron School SE Live program precourse work.
                    It serves as a showcase for the varying skills aquired during the precoure work section of the program.</p>
                <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
                <p>In 2017 I began a career as a perioperative nurse at a level one trauma center in my homestate of North Carolina. It was a very rewarding job
                    that gave a firm foundation of skills that would later be expanded upon when travel nursing. Nursing has been an integral part
                    of my life but sadly no longer carries the same sense of pride and accomplishment.</p>
